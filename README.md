## One Time Secret Sharing App
A secure, backend-focused API service that allows users to share sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) via self-destructing, one-time-use links. Each secret is encrypted before storage, can be optionally password-protected, and is permanently deleted after a single view or after expiration.
